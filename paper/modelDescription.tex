   \caption{Graphical representation of our discriminative hierarchical model for recognition of composable human activities.
At the top level, activities are represented as compositions of atomic actions that are inferred at
the intermediate level. These actions are in turn compositions of poses at the
lower level, where pose dictionaries are learned from data. Our model also learn
temporal transitions between consecutive poses and actions. Best viewed in
color.}

We build our model on top of the one presented in \cite{Lillo2014}. We improve that model in three ways: (1) adding flexibility to handle multiple types of action annotations, (2) incorporating multiple classifiers for every action instead of a single classifier, and (3) adding a \emph{garbage collector} of poses to avoid modeling noisy or non-informative poses.
