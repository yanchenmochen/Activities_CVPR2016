Feature co-occurrences are automatically found by Sequential Forward Selection at each stage of the boosting process. The selected feature co-occurrences are capable of extracting structural similarities of target objects leading to better performance. The proposed method is a generalization of the framework proposed by Viola and Jones, where each weak classifier depends only on a single feature. Experimental results obtained using four object detectors, for finding faces and three different hand gestures, respectively, show that detectors trained with the proposed algorithm yield consistently higher detection rates than those based on their framework while using the same number of features.},

  abstract = {State-of-the-art image classification methods require an intensive
	learning/training stage (using {SVM,} Boosting, etc.) In contrast,
	non-parametric nearest-neighbor {(NN)} based image classifiers require
	no training time and have other favorable properties. However, the
	large performance gap between these two families of approaches rendered
	{NN-based} image classifiers useless. We claim that the effectiveness
	of non-parametric {NN-based} image classification has been considerably
	undervalued. We argue that two practices commonly used in image classification
	methods, have led to the inferior performance of {NN-based} image
	classifiers: (i) Quantization of local image descriptors (used to
	generate "bags-of-words ", codebooks). (ii) Computation of 'image-to-image'
	distance, instead of 'image-to-class' distance. We propose a trivial
	{NN-based} classifier - {NBNN,} {(Naive-Bayes} nearest-neighbor),
	which employs {NN-} distances in the space of the local image descriptors
	(and not in the space of images). {NBNN} computes direct 'image-
	to-class' distances without descriptor quantization. We further show
	that under the {Naive-Bayes} assumption, the theoretically optimal
	image classifier can be accurately approximated by {NBNN.} Although
	{NBNN} is extremely simple, efficient, and requires no learning/training
	phase, its performance ranks among the top leading learning-based
	image classifiers. Empirical comparisons are shown on several challenging

	(1) They produce rather long histograms, which slow down the recognition
	speed especially on large-scale face database; (2) Under some certain
	circumstance, they miss the local structure as they don't consider
	the effect of the center pixel; (3) The binary data produced by them
	are sensitive to noise. Aiming at these problems, we proposed centralized
	binary pattern {(CBP)} operator. {CBP} operator has several advantages:
	(1) It reduces significantly the histograms' dimensionality by comparing
	pairs of neighbors in the operator; (2) It considers the center pixel
	point's effect and gives it the largest weight, thus improving discrimination;
	(3) By modifying the sign function of existing {LBP} operator, it
	decreases the white noise's influence on face images. Moreover, for
	the purpose of improving the robustness to small perturbation (deformation)
	of expressional images, we introduced image Euclidean distance {(IMED)}
	and embedded it in {CBP.} Experiments on two well-known facial expression
	databases demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other
	modern approaches and show that {IMED} can enhance the performance

  abstract = {Discriminative learning is challenging when examples are sets of features,
	and the sets vary in cardinality and lack any sort of meaningful
	ordering. Kernel-based classification methods can learn complex decision
	boundaries, but a kernel over unordered set inputs must somehow solve
	for correspondences ¿ generally a computationally expensive task
	that becomes impractical for large set sizes. We present a new fast
	kernel function which maps unordered feature sets to multi-resolution
	histograms and computes a weighted histogram intersection in this
	space. This "pyramid match" computation is linear in the number of
	features, and it implicitly finds correspondences based on the finest
	resolution histogram cell where a matched pair first appears. Since
	the kernel does not penalize the presence of extra features, it is
	robust to clutter. We show the kernel function is positive-definite,
	making it valid for use in learning algorithms whose optimal solutions
	are guaranteed only for Mercer kernels. We demonstrate our algorithm
	on object recognition tasks and show it to be accurate and dramatically
	faster than current approaches.},

	We adopted the idea that the appearance of an interest region can

	The most well-known descriptor built on this idea is the {SIFT} descriptor
	that uses gradient as the local feature. Thus far, existing texture
	features are not widely utilized in the context of region description.
	In this paper, we introduce a new texture feature called center-symmetric
	local binary pattern {(CS-LBP)} that is a modified version of the
	well-known local binary pattern {(LBP)} feature. To combine the strengths
	of the {SIFT} and {LBP,} we use the {CS-LBP} as the local feature
	in the {SIFT} algorithm. The resulting descriptor is called the {CS-LBP}
	descriptor. In the matching and object category classification experiments,
	our descriptor performs favorably compared to the {SIFT.} Furthermore,
	the {CS-LBP} descriptor is computationally simpler than the {SIFT.}},

	The Local Binary Pattern {(LBP)} has been proved to be effective

	the computation is done based on average values of block subregions,
	instead of individual pixels. In this way, {MB-LBP} code presents
	several advantages: (1) It is more robust than {LBP;} (2) it encodes
	not only microstructures but also macrostructures of image patterns,
	and hence provides a more complete image representation than the
	basic {LBP} operator; and (3) {MB-LBP} can be computed very efficiently
	using integral images. Furthermore, in order to reflect the uniform
	appearance of {MB-LBP,} we redefine the uniform patterns via statistical
	analysis. Finally, {AdaBoost} learning is applied to select most
	effective uniform {MB-LBP} features and construct face classifiers.
	Experiments on Face Recognition Grand Challenge {(FRGC)} ver2.0 database

	from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using
	these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by
	matching individual features to a database of features from known
	objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough
	transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and

	the configuration of facial components does contain rich discriminating

present them to the knowledge engineer for review. Once a knowledge base has
been constructed, there is the problem of keeping it consistent with changing
conditions in the real world. Concepts which are embodied in the data may drift
in time, and so some mechanism for updating the knowledge base must be
developed. As it would prove costly to periodically revisit the knowledge
acquisition phase, we propose to monitor the domain database automatically for
"significant" concept change.},

developments in contemporary computer science is the invention and application
of methods of machine learning. These have evolved from simple adaptive

from examples, (b) using prior knowledge to guide the interpretation of new
examples, (c) using this interpretation to sharpen and refine the domain
knowledge, and (d) storing and indexing example cases in ways that highlight
their similarities and differences. Such techniques have been applied in domains
ranging from the diagnosis of plant disease to the interpretation of medical
test data. This paper reviews selected methods of machine learning with an
emphasis on practical applications, and suggests how they might be used to
address some important problems in the primary production industries,

evaluation. Without some sort of preference criterion, any two theories that
explain the same set of examples are equally acceptable. This paper presents a
scheme for evaluating alternative inductive theories based on an objective
preference criterion. It strives to extract maximal redundancy from examples,
transforming structure into randomness. A major strength of the method is its
application to learning problems where negative examples of concepts are scarce
or unavailable. A new measure called model complexity is introduced, and its use
is illustrated and compared with a proof complexity measure on relational
learning tasks. The complementarity of the model and proof complexity parallels
that of model and proof-theoretic semantics. Model complexity, where applicable,
seems to be an appropriate measure for evaluating inductive logic theories.},

leading collectors of information in databases. The country, quite rightly,
places a substantial investment in stored knowledge. As databases grow, however,
interest tends to shift from techniques for retrieving individual items to
large-scale analysis of the data as a whole. Data can be analysed to view
trends, pick out anomalies, discover relationships, check that policy is turned
into practice, and so on. With large databases, such analyse scan be costly.\\

"data mining" or "machine learning," which automatically analyse large bodies of
data to discover hidden dependencies. Other methods of exploratory data

comments on our success with particular agricultural databases. We discuss those

classifying the zones they contain into meaningful categories such as text,

techniques and models for zones such as halftone pictures. The penalty for

	Abstract = {Personalizable software agents will learn new tasks from
their users. This implies being able to learn from instructions users might
give: examples, yes/no responses, and ambiguous, incomplete hints. Agents should
also exploit background knowledge customized for applications such as drawing,
word processing and form-filling. The task models that agents learn describe
data, actions and their context. Learning about data from examples and hints is
the subject of this paper.\\
\\
The Cima learning system combines evidence from examples, task knowledge and
user hints to form Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) rules for classifying,
generating or modifying data. Cima's dynamic bias manager generates candidate
features (attribute values, functions or relations), from which its DNF learning
algorithm selects relevant features and forms the rules. The algorithm is based
on a classic greedy method, with two enhancements. First, the standard learning
criterion, correct classification, is augmented with a set of utility and
instructional criteria. Utility criteria ensures that descriptions are properly
formed for use in actions, whether to classify, search for, generate or modify
data. Instructional criteria ensure that descriptions include features that
users suggest and avoid those that users reject. The second enhancement is to
augment the usual statistical metric for selecting relevant attributes with a
set of heuristics, including beliefs based on user suggestions and
application-specific background knowledge. Using multiple heuristics increases
the justification for selecting features; more important, it helps the learner
choose among alternative interpretations of hints.\\

identification of lexical subsequences or vocabulary elements, hierarchical
structuring of such subsequences, identification of elements that have
equivalent usage patterns, inference of programming constructs such as looping

	Abstract = {Strict pattern-based methods of grammar induction are often
frustrated by the apparently inexhaustible variety of novel word combinations in
large corpora. Statistical methods offer a possible solution by allowing
frequent well-formed expressions to overwhelm the infrequent ungrammatical ones.
They also have the desirable property of being able to construct robust grammars
from positive instances alone. Unfortunately, the "zero-frequency" problem
entails assigning a small probability to all possible word patterns, thus
ungrammatical n-grams become as probable as unseen grammatical ones. Further,
such grammars are unable to take advantage of inherent lexical properties that
should allow infrequent words to inherit the syntactic properties of the class
to which they belong.\\
\\
This paper describes a genetic algorithm (GA) that adapts a population of
hypothesis grammars towards a more effective model of language structure. The GA
is statistically sensitive in that the utility of frequent patterns is
reinforced by the persistence of efficient substructures. It also supports the
view of language learning as a "bootstrapping problem," a learning domain where
it appears necessary to simultaneously discover a set of categories and a set of
rules defined over them. Results from a number of tests indicate that the GA is
a robust, fault-tolerant method for inferring grammars from positive examples of
natural language.},

	Abstract = {Successful grammatical inference from a corpus of linguistic
material rests largely on the ability to tag the words of the corpus with
appropriate lexical categories. Static tagging methods, such as dictionary
lookup, often misclassify words associated with multiple categories, and
adaptive statistical taggers or context-based corrective taggers may still have
errorrates of 3 or 4 percent. Even a small proportion of lexical
misclassification may lead a syntax induction mechanism to produce an
extraordinarily large number of special-case rules.\\
\\
By treating grammar induction as a "bootstrapping" problem in which it is
necessary to simultaneously discover a set of categories and a set of rules
defined over them, lexical tagging is relieved of constraints imposed by
traditional notions of syntactic categories. Categories are created based on
salient features in the corpus under study.\\

This paper describes a statistical corpus-based approach to lexical inference
that uses linguistic notions of syntactic function to guide its analysis of a
given text. Unlike other probability-driven inference techniques, it is simple
enough to apply to the complete vocabularies of very large texts. It has been
successfully incorporated into a syntactic inference system whose resulting
grammars have been shown superior to two standard stochastic CFGs.},

measures the complexity of test data with respect to the model. It has been
evaluated on rule sets produced by several different machine learning schemes on
a large number of standard data sets. When compared with the usual percentage
correct measure, it is shown to agree with it in restricted cases. However, in
other more general cases taken from real data sets-for example, when rule sets
make multiple or no predictions-it disagrees substantially. It is argued that
the MDL measure is more reasonable in these cases and represents a better way of
assessing the significance of a rule set's performance. The question of the

	Abstract = {Decision trees in which numeric attributes are split several
ways are more comprehensible than the usual binary trees because attributes
rarely appear more than once in any path from root to leaf. There are efficient
algorithms for finding the optimal multiway split for a numeric attribute, given
the number of intervals in which it is to be divided. The problem we tackle is
how to choose this number in order to obtain small, accurate trees.\\
\\
We view each multiway decision as a model and a decision tree as a recursive
structure of such models. Standard methods of choosing between competing models
include resampling techniques (such as cross-validation, holdout, or bootstrap)
for estimating the classification error; and minimum description length
techniques. However, the recursive situation differs from the usual one, and may
call for new model selection methods.\\
\\
This paper introduces a new criterion for model selection: a resampling estimate
of the information gain. Empirical results are presented for building multiway
decision trees using this new criterion, and compared with criteria adopted by
previous authors. The new method generates multiway trees that are both smaller
and more accurate than those produced previously, and their performance is
comparable with standard binary decision trees.},

Word-processing files are dominated by free text, and respond well to

special structure. But one frequently encounters intermediate cases. For
example, in many email messages the formal header and the informal free-text
content are equally voluminous. Short SGML files often contain comparable
amounts of formal structure and informal text. Although such files may be
compressed quite well by general-purpose adaptive text compression algorithms,

noted when they take place amongst assembled cows, such as at milking times, but
may be missed entirely in herds of free-grazing animals which are only brought
in for milking twice a day, as is usual in New Zealand style systems. A common

entails assigning a small probability to all possible word patterns, thus
ungrammatical n-grams become as probable as unseen grammatical ones. Further,
such grammars are unable to take advantage of inherent lexical properties that
should allow infrequent words to inherit the syntactic properties of the class
to which they belong.\\
\\
This paper describes a genetic algorithm (GA) that adapts a population of
hypothesis grammars towards a more effective model of language structure. The GA
is statistically sensitive in that the utility of frequent patterns is
reinforced by the persistence of efficient substructures. It also supports the
view of language learning as a "bootstrapping problem," a learning domain where
it appears necessary to simultaneously discover a set of categories and a set of
rules defined over them. Results from a number of tests indicate that the GA is
a robust, fault-tolerant method for inferring grammars from positive examples of
natural language.},

	Abstract = {Over 45 years ago Claude E. Shannon estimated the entropy of
English to be about 1 bit per character [16]. He did this by having human
subjects guess samples of text, letter by letter. From the number of guesses
made by each subject he estimated upper and lower bounds of 1.3 and 0.6 bits per
character (bpc) for the entropy of English. Shannon's methodology was not
improved upon until 1978 when Cover and King [6] used a gambling approach to
estimate the upper bound to be 1.25 bpc from the same text. In the cryptographic
community n-gram analysis suggests 1.5 bpc as the asymptotic limit for 26-letter
English (Tilbourg [19]).},

exists in the theories induced by learning algorithms. Regardless of the
selected algorithm, search methodology and hypothesis representation by which
the theory is induced, one would expect the theory to make better predictions in
some regions of the description space than others. We term the fact that an
induced theory will have some regions of relatively poor performance the problem
of locally low predictive accuracy. Having characterised the problem of locally
low predictive accuracy in Instance-Based and Naive Bayesian classifiers, we
propose to counter this problem using a composite learner that incorporates both
classifiers. The strategy is to select an estimated better performing classifier
to do the final prediction during classification. Empirical results show that
the strategy is capable of partially overcoming the problem and at the same time
improving the overall performance of its constituent classifiers. We provide
explanations of why the proposed composite learner performs better than the
cross-validation method and the better of its constituent classifiers.},

batches of data provide an alternative to the common practice of learning one
theory from all the available data (i.e., the data combination approach). This
paper empirically examines the base-line behaviour of the theory combination
approach in classification tasks. We find that theory combination can lead to
better performance even if the disjoint batches of data are drawn randomly from
a larger sample, and relate the relative performance of the two approaches to
the learning curve of the classifier used.\\
\\
The practical implication of our results is that one should consider using
theory combination rather tan data combination, especially when multiple batches
of data for the same task are readily available.\\
\\
Another interesting result is that we empirically show that the near-asymptotic
performance of a single theory, in some classification task, can be
significantly improved by combining multiple theories (of the same algorithm) if
the constituent theories are substantially different and there is some
regularity in the theories to be exploited by the combination method used.
Comparisons with known theoretical results are also provided.},

generalizing rules governing social interactions and relations (particularly

particularly well-suited to this task: inductive logic programming systems, as
exemplified by FOIL. A knowledge base of relationships among individuals is
established, in the form of a series of single-predicate facts. Given a set of
positive and negative examples of a new relationship, the machine learning
programs build a Horn clause description of the target relationship. The power
of these algorithms to derive complex hypotheses is demonstrated for a set of
kinship relationships drawn from the anthropological literature. FOIL extends
the capabilities of earlier anthropology-specific learning programs by providing
a more powerful representation for induced relationships, and is better able to
learn in the face of noisy or incomplete data.},

@techreport{Cunningham1997_4,
	Abstract = {Information retrieval systems provide access to collections
of thousands, or millions, of documents, from which, by providing an appropriate
description, users can recover any one. Typically, users iteratively refine the
descriptions they provide to satisfy their needs, and retrieval systems can
utilize user feedback on selected documents to indicate the accuracy of the
description at any stage. The style of description required from the user, and
the way it is employed to search the document database, are consequences of the
indexing method used for the collection. The index may take different forms,
from storing keywords with links to individual document, to clustering documents
under related topics.\\
\\
Much of the work in information retrieval can be automated. Processes such as
document indexing and query refinement are usually accomplished by computer,
while document classification and index term selection are more often performed
manually. However, manual development and maintenance of document databases is
time-consuming, tedious, and error-prone. Algorithms that "mine" documents for
indexing information, and model user interests to help them formulate queries,
reduce the workload and can ensure more consistent behavior. Such algorithms are
based in machine learning, a dynamic, burgeoning area of computer science which
is finding application in domains ranging from "expert systems," where learning
algorithms supplement-or even supplant-domain experts for generating rules and
explanations (Langley and Simon, 1995), to "intelligent agents," which learn to
play particular, highly-specialized, support roles for individual people and are
seen by some to herald a new renaissance of artificial intelligence in
information technology (Hendler, 1997).},
