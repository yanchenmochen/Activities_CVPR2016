Based on the a paper of hierarchical modeling of complex actions, we add four modifications:
\begin{itemize}
\item Add motion cues in addition to the basal geometric  features
\item Latent assignments of actions into human parts
\item Use multiple classifiers per semantic action
\item Using more regions than the other paper.
\end{itemize}
