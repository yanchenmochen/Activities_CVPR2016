	Abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel scale- and rotation-invariant interest
  point detector and descriptor, coined SURF (Speeded Up Robust Features).
  It approximates or even outperforms previously proposed schemes with
  respect to repeatability, distinctiveness and robustness, yet can
  be computed and compared much faster.
  
  This is achieved by relying on integral images for image convolutions;
  by building on the strengths of the leading existing detectors and
  descriptors (in casu, using a Hessian matrix-based measure for the
  detector, and a distribution-based descriptor); and by simplifying
  these methods to the essential. This leads to a combination of novel
  detection, description, and matching steps. The paper presents experimental
  results on a standard evaluation set, as well as on imagery obtained
  in the context of a real-life object recognition application. Both
  show SURF's strong performance.},

	Abstract = {Ever since the introduction of freely programmable hardware components
  into modern graphics hardware, graphics processing units (GPUs) have
  become increasingly popular for general purpose computations. Especially
  when applied to computer vision algorithms where a Single set of
  Instructions has to be executed on Multiple Data (SIMD), GPU-based
  algorithms can provide a major increase in processing speed compared
  to their CPU counterparts. This paper presents methods that take
  full advantage of modern graphics card hardware for real-time scale
  invariant feature detection and matching. The focus lies on the extraction
  of feature locations and the generation of feature descriptors from
  natural images. The generation of these feature-vectors is based
  on the Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) method [1] due to its high
  stability against rotation, scale and changes in lighting condition
  of the processed images. With the presented methods feature detection
  and matching can be performed at framerates exceeding 100 frames
  per second for 640 times 480 images. The remaining time can then
  be spent on fast matching against large feature databases on the
  GPU while the CPU can be used for other tasks.},

  influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding
  that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse
  spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in
  overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results.
  The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT

	Abstract = {A novel procedure for segmenting a set of scattered 3D data obtained
  from a head and shoulders multiview sequence is presented. The procedure
  consists of two steps. In the first step, two ellipses corresponding
  to the head and the body of the person are identified based on ellipse
  fitting of the outline of the person in each image. The fitting is
  based on a fast direct least squares method using the constraint
  that forces a general conic to be an ellipse. In order to achieve
  head/body segmentation, a K-means algorithm is used to minimise the
  fitting error between the points and the two ellipsoids. In the second
  step, a 3D ellipsoid model corresponding to the head of the person
  is identified using an extension of the above method. Robustness
  and outlier removal can be achieved if a 3D ellipsoid model estimation
  technique is used in conjunction with the Median of Least Squares
  (MedLS) technique, which minimises the median of the errors corresponding
  to each 3D point. An interesting application of the proposed method
  is the combination of the 3D ellipsoid model with a generic face
  model which is adapted to the face images to provide information
  only for the high-detail front part of the head while the 3D ellipsoid
  is used for the back of the head, which is usually not visible},

	Abstract = {Occupants inside the vehicle can be deadly injured by the deployment
  of airbag at the time of crash. New collision safety technology requires
  classifying the occupant and tracking their position in real-time
  in order to adaptively deploy the air bag. This paper presents a
  fast 3D model fitting algorithm based on grayscale correlation of
  stereo disparity data, to detect and track occupant head position.
  The proposed system uses stereo vision with IR illumination for depth
  data acquisition. By detecting body center line and extra-near disparity
  calculation, this method is proven to be robust and accurate in variant
  lighting condition and occupant movement. Evaluation of the method
  shows over 98% correct head detection and near 100% correctness with
  head tracking.},

@inproceedings{Levi2004,
	Abstract = {Face detection systems have recently achieved high detection rates
  and real-time performance. However, these methods usually rely on
  a huge training database (around 5,000 positive examples for good
  performance). While such huge databases may be feasible for building
  a system that detects a single object, it is obviously problematic
  for scenarios where multiple objects (or multiple views of a single
  object) need to be detected. Indeed, even for multi-viewface detection
  the performance of existing systems is far from satisfactory. In
  this work we focus on the problem of learning to detect objects from
  a small training database. We show that performance depends crucially
  on the features that are used to represent the objects. Specifically,
  we show that using local edge orientation histograms (EOH) as features
  can significantly improve performance compared to the standard linear
  features used in existing systems. For frontal faces, local orientation
  histograms enable state of the art performance using only a few hundred
  training examples. For profile view faces, local orientation histograms
  enable learning a system that seems to outperform the state of the
  art in real-time systems even with a small number of training examples.},

	Abstract = {In this work, we implement a real-time visual tracker that targets
  the position and 3D pose of objects in video sequences, specifically
  faces. The use of stream processors for the computations and efficient
  Sparse-Template-based particle filtering allows us to achieve real-time
  processing even when tracking multiple objects simultaneously in
  high-resolution video frames. Stream processing is a relatively new
  computing paradigm that permits the expression and execution of data-parallel
  algorithms with great efficiency and minimum effort. Using a GPU
  (graphics processing unit, a consumer-grade stream processor) and
  the NVIDIA CUDA technology, we can achieve performance improvements
  as large as ten times compared to a similar CPU-only tracker. At
  the same time, the Stream processing approach opens the door to other
  computing devices, like the Cell/BE or other multicore CPUs.},

	Abstract = {Detection of objects of a given class is important for many applications.
  However it is difficult to learn a general detector with high detection
  rate as well as low false alarm rate. Especially, the labor needed
  for manually labeling a huge training sample set is usually not affordable.
  We propose an unsupervised, incremental learning approach based on
  online boosting to improve the performance on special applications
  of a set of general part detectors, which are learned from a small
  amount of labeled data and have moderate accuracy. Our oracle for
  unsupervised learning, which has high precision, is based on a combination
  of a set of shape based part detectors learned by off-line boosting.
  Our online boosting algorithm, which is designed for cascade structure
  detector, is able to adapt the simple features, the base classifiers,
  the cascade decision strategy, and the complexity of the cascade
  automatically to the special application. We integrate two noise
  restraining strategies in both the oracle and the online learner.
  The system is evaluated on two public video corpora.},
