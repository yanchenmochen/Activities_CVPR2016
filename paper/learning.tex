[IL: These are notes, don't evaluate it yet]

The loss function $\Delta((y_i,V_i),(y,V))$ can no longer depend in the value of $V_i$, since it is now a latent variable. But, as we do know the time span of the actions in all videos, we can compute a list $A_t$ of possible actions for frame $t$, and transform the original loss function into
\begin{equation}
\Delta(y_i,(y,V)) = \lambda_y(y_i \ne y) + \lambda_v\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T \delta(v_t \notin A_t)
\end{equation}
and use the same group of actions for each frame to impute the labels of actions and poses for each frame during the inference of latent variables

The model parameters are learned with a Latent Structural SVM formulation, iterating between searching the best assignments of poses $Z$ given the model parameters, and finding the best classifiers given the poses $Z$:
\begin{equation}
 Z_i^* = \max_{Z_i} E(X_i, Z_i, V_i, y_i)
\end{equation}
